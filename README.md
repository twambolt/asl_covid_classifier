# asl_covid_classifier

This is a repo containing the data used for my senior project that is a work in progress. 
 
The link to the Colab notebook where all of my code is written is here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E4cLukZLJ2NkFILD_x7LOoMouX1Ps7hO?usp=sharing

When training the model, I used a runtime with a GPU hardware accelerator.

The full list of references are included in my paper which is included in this repository. (ML Classifier for Covid Symptoms Document)
